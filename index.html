    <h1>My name is Brianna</h1>
    <p>I am currently a student at Wake tech and my program of study is Information Technology. I am at Wake Tech as a part of a program at my high school called 13th Year where you can take classes at Wake Tech after senior year and get an Associates Degree. I am currently learning how to code in one of my classes and I'm really enjoying it so far. At first, coding seemed complicated and kind of scary, but now that I am learning how to do it, it isn't that bad and is actually getting eassier and easier as I continue to do it. When I'm not doing school work, I like to do a variety of things, including drawing, playing video games, reading, and watching TV.</p>
