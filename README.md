# About Me
## My Interests 
I like to draw, play video games, watch movies, read, and write on occasion.
## Websites I Reccommend
* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) - I think DuckDuckGo is a far superior option to google when it comes to privacy when using it. It doesn't track your data and doesn't sell your personal info to third parties.
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - I think Youtube is a great free source for personal entertainment and it is user friendly and easy to use. You can search for the content that you want to see and subcribe to creators on it to see more of all of the content you want.
